# BULINGO Website
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## React Guide
Create React App is divided into two packages:

* create-react-app is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
* react-scripts is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).

When you run create-react-app on terminal, it always creates the project with the latest version of react-scripts so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.

Generally, bumping the react-scripts version in package.json and running npm install (or yarn install) in this folder is enough.

## React Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
```
### npm test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
```
### npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
```
### npm run eject
```
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. 
```
